The TimeStamp microservice uses NodeJS and ExpressJS to allow a user to pass a string as a parameter into the address bar and it will check to see if the string contains a unix timestamp
or a natural language date. If it does, the microservice returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language date. Otherwise, the microservice
returns null for those properties.
